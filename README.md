### Isn't My Ugly Broken Website ~Charming?
This was made when I was a web baby, circa 2017. It's a little broken and a little ugly but I believe that at its core it's still a great concept. Slowly I'd like to take a stab at recreating my college projects. Since graduation I've learned that I wasn't as good as I thought was (art school kids amirite?). I owe a lot to my mentors (looking at you Jim ಥ﹏ಥ) and everything they've taught me about designing with intention, adding delight, and always pushing my work one step further. So... stay tuned for a cooler, more intential design.
